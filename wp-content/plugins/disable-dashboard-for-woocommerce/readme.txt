* Hide marketplace link on the Payments Settings screen

== Disable unused core WordPress features ==

By default, WordPress saves each post revision in your database which may lead to the enormous size of your database. Disable post revisions and sleep well.

Turn off the built-in WordPress File Editor to improve your site’s speed and performance.
