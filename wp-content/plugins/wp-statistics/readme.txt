== Description ==
= WP Statistics: THE #1 WORDPRESS STATISTICS PLUGIN =
Do you need a simple tool to know your website statistics? Do you need to represent these statistics? Are you caring about your users’ privacy while analyzing who are interested in your business or website? With WP Statistics you can know your website statistics without any need to send your users’ data anywhere. You can know how many people visit your personal or business website, where they’re coming from, what browsers and search engines they use, and which of your contents, categories, tags and users get more visits.

[Checkout Demo](https://wp-statistics.com/demo)

= Data Privacy =
WP Statistics stores all data, including IP addresses, safely on your server. WP Statistics respects user privacy and is GDPR, CCPA compliant, as detailed on our [GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant](https://wp-statistics.com/resources/what-we-collect/) page. It anonymizes IPs, uses IP hashing with random daily Salt Mechanism for extra security, and follows Do Not Track (DNT) requests from browsers. This keeps user information private while giving you insights into your website traffic.

= REPORT BUGS =
If you encounter any bug, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/wp-statistics/wp-statistics/issues/new) where we can act upon them more efficiently. Since [Github](https://github.com/wp-statistics/wp-statistics) is not a support forum, just bugs are welcomed, and any other request will be closed.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-statistics` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure the Date and Time are set correctly in WordPress.
4. Go to the plugin settings page and configure as required (note this will also include downloading the GeoIP database for the first time).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= GDPR Compliant? =
The greatest advantage of WP Statistics is that all the data is saved locally in WordPress.
This helps a lot while implementing the new GDPR restrictions; because it’s not necessary to create a data processing contract with an external company! [Read more about WP Statistics compliance with GDPR](https://wp-statistics.com/resources/what-we-collect/).

= Does WP Statistics support Multisite? =
WP Statistics doesn't officially support the multisite feature; however, it does have limited functionally associated with it and should function without any issue. However, no support is provided at this time.
Version 8.8 is the first release that can be installed, upgraded and removed correctly on multi-site. It also has some basic support for the network admin menu. This should not be taken as an indication that WP Statistics fully supports the multisite, but only should be considered as a very first step.

= Does WP Statistics work with caching plugins? =
Yes, the cache support added in v12.5.1

If you're using a plugin cache:
* Don't forget to clear your enabled plugin cache.
* You should enable the plugin cache option in the Settings page.
* Making sure the below endpoint registered in your WordPress.

To register, go to the Permalink page and update the permalink with press Save Changes.

= What’s the difference between Visits and Visitors? =
Visits is the number of page hits your site has received.
Visitors is the number of unique users which have visited your site.
Visits should always be greater than Visitors (though, there are a few cases when this won’t be true due to having low visits).
The average number of pages a visitor views on your site is Visits/Visitors.

= Are All visitors’ locations set to ‘unknown’? =
Make sure you’ve downloaded the GeoIP database and the GeoIP code is enabled.
Also, if you are running an internal test site with non-routable IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x or 172.28.x.x or 10.x.x.x), these addresses will be always shown as ‘unknown’. You can define a location IP for these IP addresses in the “Country code for private IP addresses” setting.

= I’m using another statistics plugin/service and get different numbers from them, why? =
Probably, each plugin/service is going to give you different statistics on visits and visitors; there are several reasons for this:

* Web crawler detections
* Detection methods (Javascript vs. Server Side PHP)
* Centralized exclusions

Services that use centralized databases for spam and robot detections , such as Google Analytics, have better detection than WP Statistics.

= Not all referrals are showing up in the search words list, why? =
Search Engine Referrals and Words are highly dependent on the search engines providing the information to us. Unfortunately, we can’t do anything about it; we report everything we receive.

= Does WP Statistics support the UTM parameters? =
Yes, It does! WP Statistics logs all query strings in the URL such as UTM parameters.

= PHP v8.0 Support? =
WP Statistics is PHP 8.0 compliant.

= IPv6 Support? =
WP Statistics supports IPv6 as of version 11.0; however, PHP must be compiled with IPv6 support enabled; otherwise you may see warnings when a visitor from an IPv6 address hits your site.

You can check if IPv6 support is enabled in PHP by visiting the Optimization > Resources/Information->Version Info > PHP IPv6 Enabled section.

If IPv6 is not enabled, you may see a warning like:

	Warning: inet_pton() [function.inet-pton]: Unrecognized address 2003:0006:1507:5d71:6114:d8bd:80c2:1090

= What 3rd party services does the plugin use? =
IP location services are provided by data created by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/), to detect the Visitor's location (Country & City) the plugin downloads the GeoLite2 Database created by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) on your server locally and use it.
